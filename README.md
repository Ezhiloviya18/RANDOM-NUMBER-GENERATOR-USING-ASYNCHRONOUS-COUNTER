## Introduction

The Random Number Generator using Asynchronous Counter project focuses on implementing a hardware solution to generate random numbers using an asynchronous counter. The concept leverages hardware components to generate unpredictable sequences of numbers that can serve various applications, such as cryptography, simulations, and more.

## Report

The project report, which is the main content of this repository, provides in-depth information about the project's goals, methodology, hardware design, implementation details, and results. Due to the nature of the project being hardware-oriented, the report should contain diagrams, schematics, explanations of design choices, and the logic behind the asynchronous counter-based random number generation.
